# CHANGELOG

This is a manually generated log to track changes to the repository for each release. 
Each section should include general headers such as **Implemented enhancements** 
and **Merged pull requests**. Critical items to know are:

 - renamed commands
 - deprecated / removed commands
 - changed defaults
 - backward incompatible changes
 - migration guidance
 - changed behaviour

The versions coincide with releases on pypi.

## [0.0.x](https://github.com/singularityhub/singularity-compose/tree/master) (0.0.x)
 - alpha release with simple (single container) working example (0.0.1)
 - dummy release (0.0.0)
