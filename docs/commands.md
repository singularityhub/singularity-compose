# Commands

The following commands are currently supported. Remember, you must be in the 
present working directory of the compose file to reference the correct instances.

## Build

Build will either build a container recipe, or pull a container to the
instance folder. In both cases, it's named after the instance so we can
easily tell if we've already built or pulled it. This is typically
the first step that you are required to do in order to build or pull your
recipes. It ensures reproducibility because we ensure the container binary
exists first.

```bash
$ singularity-compose build
```

The working directory is the parent folder of the singularity-compose.yml file.
If the build requires sudo (if you've defined sections in the config that warrant
setting up networking with sudo) the build will instead give you an instruction
to run with sudo.

## Up

If you want to both build and bring them up, you can use "up." Note that for
builds that require sudo, this will still stop and ask you to build with sudo.

```bash
$ singularity-compose up
```

### resolv.conf

By default, singularity-compose will generate a resolv.conf for you to bind
to the container, instead of using the host. It's a simple template
that uses Google nameservers:

```
# This is resolv.conf generated by singularity-compose. It is provided
# to provide Google nameservers. If you don't want to have it generated
# and bound by default, use the up --no-resolv argument.

nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
```

If you want to disable this:

```bash
$ singularity-compose up --no-resolv
Creating app
```

## Create

Given that you have built your containers with `singularity-compose build`,
you can create your instances as follows:

```bash
$ singularity-compose create
```

Akin to "up," you can also disable the generation of the resolv.conf.

```bash
$ singularity-compose create --no-resolv
Creating app
```


## restart

Restart is provided as a convenience to run "down" and then "up." You can
specify most of the same arguments as create or up.

```bash
$ singularity-compose restart --no-resolv
Stopping app
Creating app
```


## ps

You can list running instances with "ps":

```bash
$ singularity-compose ps
INSTANCES  NAME PID     IMAGE
1           app	6659	app.sif
2            db	6788	db.sif
3         nginx	6543	nginx.sif
```

## Shell

It's sometimes helpful to peek inside a running instance, either to look at permissions,
inspect binds, or manually test running something.
You can easily shell inside of a running instance:

```bash
$ singularity-compose shell app
Singularity app.sif:~/Documents/Dropbox/Code/singularity/singularity-compose-example> 
```

## Exec

You can easily execute a command to a running instance:

```bash
$ singularity-compose exec app ls /
bin
boot
code
dev
environment
etc
home
lib
lib64
media
mnt
opt
proc
root
run
sbin
singularity
srv
sys
tmp
usr
var
```

## Run

If a container has a `%runscript` section (or a Docker entrypoint/cmd that 
was converted to one), you can run that script easily:

```bash
$ singularity-compose run app
```

If your container didn't have any kind of runscript, the startscript
will be used instead.


## Down

You can bring one or more instances down (meaning, stopping them) by doing:

```bash
$ singularity-compose down
Stopping (instance:nginx)
Stopping (instance:db)
Stopping (instance:app)
```

To stop a custom set, just specify them:


```bash
$ singularity-compose down nginx
```

## Logs

You can of course view logs for all instances, or just specific named ones:

```bash
$ singularity-compose logs --tail 10
nginx ERR

## Config

You can load and validate the configuration file (singularity-compose.yml) and
print it to the screen as follows:

```bash
$ singularity-compose config
{
    "version": "1.0",
    "instances": {
        "nginx": {
            "build": {
                "context": "./nginx",
                "recipe": "Singularity.nginx"
            },
            "volumes": [
                "./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf:ro",
                "./uwsgi_params.par:/etc/nginx/uwsgi_params.par:ro",
                ".:/code",
                "./static:/var/www/static",
                "./images:/var/www/images"
            ],
            "volumes_from": [
                "app"
            ],
            "ports": [
                "80"
            ]
        },
        "db": {
            "image": "docker://postgres:9.4",
            "volumes": [
                "db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data"
            ]
        },
        "app": {
            "build": {
                "context": "./app"
            },
            "volumes": [
                ".:/code",
                "./static:/var/www/static",
                "./images:/var/www/images"
            ],
            "ports": [
                "5000:80"
            ],
            "depends_on": [
                "nginx"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
