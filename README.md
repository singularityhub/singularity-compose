# Singularity Compose

This is a simple orchestration library for Singularity containers, akin to
Docker Compose. See the [specification]() and the [documentation]() for
details, or more examples below.

## Examples

 - [singularity-compose-simple](https://www.github.com/singularityhub/singularity-compose-simple): A single container example (working in full).
 - [singularity-compose-example](https://www.github.com/singularityhub/singularity-compose-example): The same application split into multiple containers, currently has issues because of Docker iptables edits (working on figuring out a solution).
