# CHANGELOG

This is a manually generated log to track changes to the repository for each release. 
Each section should include general headers such as **Implemented enhancements** 
and **Merged pull requests**. Critical items to know are:

 - renamed commands
 - deprecated / removed commands
 - changed defaults
 - backward incompatible changes
 - migration guidance
 - changed behaviour

The versions coincide with releases on pypi.

 - adding run command (0.0.15)
 - ensuring that builds are streamed (0.0.14)
 - adding more build options to build as build-flags (0.0.13)
 - when not using sudo, need to set --network=none, and catching exec error (0.0.12)
 - pyaml version should be for newer kind, and still check for attribute (0.0.11)
